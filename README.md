# apps
My monorepo of python scripts, modules, and packages. I'm currently publishing this only to get help with some issues. Almost all of the files are gitignored. https://github.com/riverscuomo/apps/blob/master/.gitignore

## Note to Self:
To install the submodules in a way that you'll always have the latest commit, try this in each submodule directory instead of `pip install .` or `poetry install` :
"If you do what's called an editable install you won't have to re-install your own code that you're actively editing. People typically do that with `pip install -e .` You can then point pip at the directory holding the code, e.g. . is common for the current directory."

`pip install -e .`


Please let me know if this doesn't seem like a reasonable way to import and run a large number of packages on a regular schedule.

here is the report it prints after running each day.
